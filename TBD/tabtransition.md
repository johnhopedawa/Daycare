## Tab Transition Plan

Short guide for phasing from the current navbar/menu into the new tab layout from `Thingstodo.md`.

---

## Current Admin Tabs (Today)

- Dashboard (`/`)
- Schedule (`/admin/schedule`)
- Educators (`/admin/educators`)
- Families (`/admin/families`)
- Attendance (`/admin/attendance`)
- Billing (`/admin/billing`)
- Pay Periods (`/admin/pay-periods`)
- Reports (`/admin/reports`)
- Files (`/admin/files`)
- Settings (`/admin/settings`)

## Future Tabs (Thingstodo)

- Dashboard – birthdays, room ratios, activities logged today
- My School – dropdown of rooms
- Attendance
- Messaging
- Billing
- Enrollment
- Paperwork
- Admissions – child profiles with picture + name
- Staff Scheduling
- Marketing
- Website
- Reporting – dropdown of reports

---

## Mapping: Current → Future

- Dashboard → **Dashboard**
  - Keep as your main admin home.
  - Add birthdays, room ratios, “today’s” activity and alert widgets.

- Schedule → **Staff Scheduling** + part of **My School**
  - Staff Scheduling: weekly staff shifts, coverage, time-off.
  - My School: view schedules at the room level (who is in which room).

- Educators → **Staff Scheduling** (staff info) and future **HR/Staff** area (later)
  - Short term: keep Educators tab.
  - Long term: fold staff details into Staff Scheduling/HR.

- Families → **Admissions** + **Enrollment** + **Paperwork** + **Messaging**
  - Admissions: leads, waitlist, prospects, first contact.
  - Enrollment: enrolled children, start dates, room assignments.
  - Paperwork: required forms, immunizations, expiring documents.
  - Messaging: contact families from their profile or in bulk.

- Attendance → **Attendance**
  - Keep its own tab.
  - Connect with Dashboard (today’s attendance status).

- Billing → **Billing**
  - Same tab, improved view (overdue, paid, subsidies).

- Pay Periods → stays under admin (backend/finance section)
  - Can later live under a “Back Office” section, not exposed in parent-facing tabs.

- Reports → **Reporting**
  - Turn into a dropdown: attendance, revenue, staff hours, enrollment trends, etc.

- Files → **Paperwork** (and general document storage)
  - Child-specific uploads show under Paperwork/Admissions.
  - General center documents remain in a simple Files/Docs area.

- Settings → stays as **Settings**
  - System-wide configuration, branding, roles, etc.

## New Tabs Without Direct Current Match

- My School
  - New “home” for rooms, room capacity, ratios, and room-level views.

- Marketing
  - Track tour sources, referrals, basic lead metrics.

- Website
  - Manage public site content, announcements, maybe a simple calendar.

## Phase-In Suggestions

- Phase 1: Enhance existing tabs
  - Add birthdays/ratios to Dashboard.
  - Add basic document tracking under Families/Files.

- Phase 2: Introduce new tabs alongside old ones
  - Add My School, Admissions, Enrollment, Paperwork, Messaging.
  - Keep Families until data and workflows are split.

- Phase 3: Clean up and rename
  - Remove Families once Admissions/Enrollment/Paperwork cover its use.
  - Group back-office things (Pay Periods, Settings) under an “Admin/Settings” area if desired.
